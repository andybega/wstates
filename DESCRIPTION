Description: wstates makes it easy to spatial lag variables in country-year
  data sets. Since the number of indepdendent states fluctuates over time, the
  weights matrices for spatial lagging are also non-constant. wstates automates
  the process of finding the correct one at any given time. Companian package 
  for the states package.
